# Protoplasm  
Split, evolve, attack, mine, photosynthesize your way to the top. Become the greatest species in the petri dish. This real time strategy(RTS) focuses on unique mechanics for developing and proliferating: rather than creating structures for defence, research, or production; you simply specialize your cells, split them off a few times, and conquer the world! (er... petri dish.)
